# EnforcerBot
A simple Python bot to enforce the rules.

## MOTIVATION
Most Discord bots that I've seen do not provide actual user activity levels. I wanted to build a bot that monitors user idle times as well as
automatically boot the user if idle for x amount of time. Beyond that, bot users can set Server rules.

## Intended Features
