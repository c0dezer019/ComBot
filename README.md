# IdleBot
A simple Python bot to track server activity.

IdleBot monitors a user or server's idle times. IdleBot can be used to trim the member list of members who are no longer active or have an interest in the guild. The bot provides full customization so that it only behaves the way you expect it to, all-the-while providing simple, easy to understand data.
